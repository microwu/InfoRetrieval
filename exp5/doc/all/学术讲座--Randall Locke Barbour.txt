嘉宾简介：
Having been formally trained in the life sciences, (Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry; Professional License in Laboratory Medicine), throughout most of his professional career Randall Barbour, Ph.D., has devoted attention to developing new methodologies (hardware – analysis methods) for the optical inspection of living tissue. Original descriptions include the method of diffuse optical tomography (1988), diffuse fluorescence tomography (1995), MR-guided optical tomography (1995), and dynamic optical tomography (1999). 
In 2000, Dr. Barbour founded NIRx Medical Technologies to pursue the growing application potential that this new field offered. Today, NIRx is a leading provider of fNIRS imaging solutions to the world-wide neuroscience community. NIRx system users span more than 35 countries operating at more 400 of the world’s most prestigious institutions.
