讲座摘要：
Dementias pose major socio-medical burden,
currently there is still no cure. Novel proteomics approaches hold promise to
identify alterations of the brain proteome that could provide clues to the
disease etiology. Here, we report our proteomics findings on human post-mortem
brains affected with (1) Alzheimer’s Disease across Braak’s stages 0-6, and (2)
their interaction with ageing; (3) the analysis of  single cell types with granulovacuolar
degeneration versus cells with neurofibrillary tangles; and (4) AD tissues with
capillary cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We further studied (5) Frontotemporal
Dementia with mutations of C9orf72, MAPT or PGRN. Brain slices and single cells
identified by immunostaining were collected by laser-microdissection, and
processed for quantitative proteomics analysis by data dependent and data
independent LC-MS/MS analysis. These studies confirmed known cellular changes,
and identified novel proteins that may underlie distinct aspects of the
diseases, some of which hold promise to be developed as biomarker.
嘉宾简介：
Dr. Ka Wan Li currently works at the
Department of Neurosciences-CNCR, Vrije University Amsterdam. He is the group
leader of Neuroproteomics at Vrije University Amsterdam. Ka Wan does research
in Neuroscience. His current research focus on the characterization of protein
nano-machineries that underlies synapse function and plasticity, and study
synapse/tissue proteome changes in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric
disorders. State-of-the-art quantitative proteomics techniques are employed,
using both human post-mortem brain tissues from patients and healthy controls,
and the diverse mouse models of brain disorders.
